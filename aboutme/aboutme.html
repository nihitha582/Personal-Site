				Hello! My name is Nihitha Pinnamaraju, but most people just call me Nihi. I am currently a senior studying Computer Science in the College
			of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of Michigan. This upcoming summer, I will be interning as a software engineer at JP Morgan Chase and Co. From a young age itself, I have had an interest in both tech and business, and while I have had experiences in each field separately, I want to be able to combine my two passions in my future professional career. </br> </br>
				Whatever I may do in the future, I want to be able to make an impact in tech industry, especially when it comes to women. I not only want to put my Computer
			Science knowledge to use in order to advance programs, but I also want to inspire and motivate women to step out and shine as well. I hope through my years at the University of Michigan, my internship experiences, and the various people I will meet, that I can make my vision come true! </br> </br>
				Aside from academics and my professional interests, I love being active and outdoors. I have been to around ten national parks and have hiked some gorgeous 
			trails. One of my side goals is to hopefully be able to visit all of the national parks. Along with being outdoors and traveling, I also enjoy video editing. I may not be the best at it, but I hope that once I get to travel more I can pick up a few editing tricks and film secrets and create some stunning content. I have a few videos up on youtube, so if you want to check them out, then be sure to follow the link on the Contact Me page!
			I also greatly enjoy giving back to my community to the best of my ability. One area of this that particularly interests me is encouraging students to choose the tech track instead of shying away from it.
			I truly believe that there are endless opportunities within the tech field, and I offer tutoring services for the intro programming class and also offer interview prep help.
			I love helping students in those areas because they are what get people excited about the industry and want to pursue a career in the field.
